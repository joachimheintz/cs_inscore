You can use CsoundQt (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound) or run Csound (http://sourceforge.net/projects/csound) from the Command line. The examples in CsoundQt have some features the commandline version do not have (because of the widgets). For general information about installing Csound, see http://en.flossmanuals.net/csound/index.
